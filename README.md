#  Real-time Violence Detection using PoseLSTM and PoseTransformer

In this phase of the project, we developed a **real-time violence detection pipeline** based on human pose estimation. Our custom architecture, **PoseLSTM** and **PoseTransformer**, utilizes pose landmarks to identify violent actions from webcam or video input in real time.

---

## 🎯 Key Objectives

- Generate a **custom pose-based dataset** using MediaPipe.
- Train an LSTM-based deep learning model (`PoseLSTM`) or Transformer-based deep learning model (`PoseTransformer`) on pose features.
- Deploy a real-time pipeline with **YOLO**, **DeepSORT**, **MediaPipe**, and the trained model.

---

## 📁 Dataset Generation (Custom)

We engineered our own dataset using the `pose_data_generation.py` script:

1. **Pose Landmark Extraction**
   - Extracted **33 pose landmarks** per person using **MediaPipe Pose**.
   - Each landmark contains: `[x, y, z, visibility]` → Total of **132 features per frame**.

2. **Batching and Labeling**
   - Each sample consists of a fixed number of frames (e.g., 20) forming one batch.
   - Labels are assigned as `Violent` or `Non-Violent` during data generation.

3. **Storage Format**
   - Data is stored as `.csv` files.
   - Each row represents a frame's 132 pose features.

 Custom parameters:
- Number of batches
- Frames per batch
- Label for the sample

##  Model Architecture – PoseLSTM

- The model is a **4-layer LSTM** network trained on the `.csv` pose data.
- Trained using the `poselstm.ipynb` and `posetransformer.ipynb` notebook.
- Achieved **99.95% accuracy** on **PoseLSTM** and **98.59% accuracy** on **PoseTransformer** models using our generated dataset during evaluation.

**Input shape:** `(batch_size, sequence_length, 132)`  
**Output:** Binary classification (Violent / Non-Violent)

## ▶️ Sample Working Demo 

This video presents a basic demonstration of our Violence Detection System in action. While it does not feature intense or aggressive fight sequences, the system effectively analyzes arm movements and body posture to accurately classify actions as violent or non-violent.

**Note:** The performance of the system can be significantly enhanced with higher-quality hardware and camera input. Currently, it is operating on a basic laptop with an Intel i5-9300H CPU and no dedicated GPU support.
